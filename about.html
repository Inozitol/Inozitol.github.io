            <b>Did you expect me to write about me seriously?</b>
			<br>
			<p>
            Well then. I'm a really easily stressed out student, that likes to complain about the most mundane things. I would write something really edgy here, but why bother? But if I should explain myself as a normal person...than I would not as only others can make opinions on others. Always judge, yourself quietly, give opinions, otherways expect broken mind.

			<br>
			<b>What am I capable of?</b>
            <p>I really like to tweak around with Linux systems and stuff like that. Proof of this is the fact that I'am writing this on <del>vim</del> neovim on my majestic Thinkpad X200 with <del>Slackware 14.2</del> Debian 10 installed on it. Other than that, I have a few amateur-ish projects written mostly in C and C++ and some other languages such as PHP, JavaScript and Python. I tried some C# at one point, but it got me into depression and I realized it's not for me.</p>
            <br>
			<b>What I like?</b>
            <p>Well, ofcourse I like all my friends as they constantly keep up with my bull...well I shoudn't swear here. And surely I love to code something, while listening to latest genere my mind desires. What genere you ask? Only stars would know. It ranges from Alternative through Shoegaze to Synthwave. But I'am no alien, so a nice book, rainy weather and some warm beverage will always make my day prettier.
            <br>Oh yea, and Bob Ross. If you don't know him, look him up.</p>
			<b>Do you think this website is bad?</b>
			<p>You are certainly not wrong as I never liked web design. But it's a nice way to write something about myself, with a chance that somebody will read it.</p>
