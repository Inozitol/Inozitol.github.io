			<b>DID YOU EXPECT ME TO WRITE ABOUT ME SERIOUSLY?</b>
			<br>
			<p>
			WELL THEN. I'M A REALLY BORED STUDENT, THAT LIKES TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE MOST MUNDANE THINGS. I COULD BE THE MOST QUIET PERSON IN THE WHOLE ROOM, OR THE MOST ANNOYING ONE. WHAT FACTORS DECIDE ON WHAT KIND OF PERSON I'AM AT THE MOMENT? PROBABLY STARS, I DON'T KNOW.
			</p>
			<br>
			<b>WHAT AM I CAPABLE OF?</b>
			<p>I REALLY LIKE TO TWEAK AROUND WITH SOME OPEN SOURCE SYSTEMS, LIKE LINUX. PROOF OF THIS, IS THE FACT THAT I'AM WRITING THIS ON VIM, ON MY MAJESTIC THINKPAD X200 WITH SLACKWARE 14.2 INSTALLED ON IT. OTHER THAN THAT, I HAVE A FEW AMATEUR-ISH PROJECTS WRITTEN IN C++. AND IF YOU DIDN'T CATCH ON THAT BY NOW, I CAN WRITE A REALLY SIMPLE WEBSITE.</p>
			<b>WHAT I LIKE?</b>
			<p>NOTHING BEATS LAYING ON A COUCH AND WATCHING THE JOY OF PAINTING BY BOB ROSS. I NEVER PAINTED ANYTING, BUT THERE IS SOMETHING AMAZINGLY CALMING ABOUT THAT MAN. OTHER THAN THAT, I LIKE TO PLAY GUITAR, GO FOR A RUN/WALK (DEPENDING BY THE WEATHER AND WILLINGNESS), OR JUST PLAY SOME GAMES WITH SOME OF MY FRIENDS.</p>
			<b>DO YOU THINK THIS WEBSITE IS BAD?</b>
			<p>ATLEAST IT'S HONEST. I DON'T NEED TO LIE TO ANYBODY ABOUT ME.</p>
